                Social Driven Navigation (member media aggrigate ) of multimedia/rss feed videos.
                Designed as a way to store and search rss:videos submitted by users, viewable platform wide.
                (storage of feed videos would require cloud storage capital ) this application can bring to a company a singular accesss to real time and changing information/organization can make pivital changes as the specific searched information becomes available /end-user can view videos on uploaded rss feed.</p>

            <p>Do a survey of the Web to find about five web sites that might have similar ideas as yours.
Instagram, twitter, youtube, facebook, tic-toc all play some variation of this theme.
                My idea is to simply allow users to provide rss feeds to be 'read' for media content.
            and added to the menu of the website where other users can search for topics in mass.</p>
